# Houseplants Dataset

To generate the houseplants dataset you need to crawl images of houseplants . To do this, start the crawler with this command `python houseplants_crawler.py`.

After the crawling of the images we need to clean some corrupted images, which can not be used for training. To do this run the cleaning script with `python remove_corrupt_images.py`.

After this you can start with the provided tutorial.
